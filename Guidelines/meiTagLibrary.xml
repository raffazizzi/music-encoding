          <head>&lt;abbr&gt; abbreviation</head>
          <div type="desc">
            <head>Description:</head>
            <p>A generic element for a shortened form of a word, including an
              acronym. The type attribute may be used to classify the
              abbreviation according to some convenient typology. Sample values
              include: suspension - the abbreviation provides the first
              letter(s) of the word or phrase, omitting the remainder;
              contraction - the abbreviation omits some letter(s) in the middle;
              brevigraph - the abbreviation comprises a special symbol or mark;
              superscription - the abbreviation includes writing above the line;
              acronym - the abbreviation comprises the initial letters of the
              words of a phrase; title - the abbreviation is for a title of
              address (Dr, Ms, Mr, ...); organization - the abbreviation is for
              the name of an organization; geographic - the abbreviation is for
              a geographic name. This tag is the mirror image of the
              &lt;expan&gt; tag; both allow the encoder to transcribe
              both an abbreviation and its expansion. In &lt;abbr&gt;,
              however, the original is transcribed as the content of the element
              and the expansion as an attribute value; &lt;expan&gt;
              reverses this. The choice between the two is up to the user. The
              &lt;abbr&gt; tag is not required; if appropriate, the
              encoder may transcribe abbreviations in the source text silently,
              without tagging them. If abbreviations are not transcribed
              directly but expanded silently, then the MEI header should so
              indicate. The cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty
              ascribed to the expansion of the abbreviation. The expan attribute
              gives an expansion of the abbreviation. The resp attribute
              contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the
              editor or transcriber responsible for supplying the expansion of
              the abbreviation.</p>

            <head>Description:</head>
            <p>A variation in pitch (often microtonal) upwards or downwards
              during the course of a note. Typically, the performer attacks the
              note at "true" pitch, bends the intonation, then returns to true
              pitch. The bend element can also be used for scoop, plop, falloff,
              and doit performance effects. It should *not* be used for l.v.
              (laissez vibrer) indications. Precise performance data that
              differs from the logical events in a measure may be recorded
              within the bend element. The starting point of the bend may be
              indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid
              attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting
              attribute.</p>

            <p>A curved line that cannot be represented by a more specific
              element, such as a &lt;slur&gt;. The starting point of the
              curve may be identified in absolute output coordinate terms using
              the x1 and y1 attributes or relative to the location of another
              element using the startid attribute. The attributes in the
              att.visualoffset class may be used to record horizontal, vertical,
              or time offsets from the absolute coordinates or from the location
              of the referenced element. Similarly, the terminal point of the
              curve may be recorded using either the x2,y2 coordinates or in
              relation to the location of another element using the endid
              attribute. Attributes in the att.visualoffset2 class maybe used to
              record the offsets of the ending point. The bulge attribute or,
              alternatively, the bezier attribute, describes the shape of the
              curve. The bulge attribute describes the curve as a set of
              distance values above or below an imaginary line connecting the
              endpoints of the curve while the bezier attribute records the
              placement of Bezier control points as a series of space-separated
              xy coordinate pairs, eg. 19 45 -32 118. The bulge attribute must
              contain one or more values of the NUMBER datatype. The rend
              attribute captures the appearance of the curve.</p>

              &lt;damage&gt; tag with this attribute should only be used
              where the text may be read with some confidence; data supplied
              from other sources should be tagged as &lt;supplied&gt;.
              The extent attribute indicates approximately how much text is in
              the damaged area, in notes, measures, inches, or any appropriate
              unit, where this cannot be deduced from the contents of the tag.
              For example, the damage may span structural divisions in the text
              so that the tag must then be empty of content. In the case of
              damage (deliberate defacement, etc.) assignable to an identifiable
              hand, the hand attribute signifies the hand responsible for the
              damage.</p>

              this. The choice between the two elements is up to the user. If
              appropriate, the encoder may expand abbreviations in the source
              text silently, without tagging them. If this is done, the MEI
              header should indicate this has been done. The abbr attribute
              gives the abbreviation in its unexpanded form. The cert attribute
              signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the expansion of the
              abbreviation. The resp attribute contains an ID reference to an
              element containing the name of the editor or transcriber
              responsible for supplying the expansion of the abbreviation held
              as the content of the &lt;expan&gt; element.</p>

              &lt;del&gt; if the omission is because the material is

              spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, annotator, or
              corrector. An indication of how much material has been omitted
              from the transcription may be recorded in the extent attribute.
              The unit attribute names the unit used for describing the extent
              of the gap. The reason attribute gives the reason for omission.
              Sample values include 'sampling', 'irrelevant', 'cancelled'. The
              resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing

            <head>Description:</head>
            <p>The mdiv element may contain one or both of 2 possible views of
              the music. The score view is the traditional full and open score
              while the parts view contains each performer's view of the score;
              that is, his part. These 2 views are necessary because it is not
              always possible or desirable to generate one from the other. The
              score and parts elements are placed here and not directly within
              the body element because score and part characteristics may change
              from mdiv to mdiv. For example, the 2nd movement of a symphony may
              require different performing forces (and therefore different score
              and part layout) than the other movements. The mdiv element may be
              recursively nested in order to represent music which exhibits this
              kind of structure. For example, an opera is normally divided into
              acts, which are in turn divided into scenes. This may be
              represented by the following markup: &lt;mdiv&gt;
              &lt;- the opera &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;- act I
              &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;- scene i &lt;mdiv&gt;
              &lt;- scene ii &lt;/mdiv&gt; &lt;mdiv&gt;
              &lt;- act II &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;- scene i
              &lt;mdiv&gt; &lt;- scene ii &lt;/mdiv&gt;

              (e.g. 'up to the double bar', 'the end of the bar'), but
              'bar-line' is also common." (New Grove) In MEI, the measure

                rendition of the left barline. It is present here only for
                facilitation of translation from legacy encodings which use it.
                Usually, it can be safely ignored.</item>
              <item>n, NMTOKEN, optional<lb/>provides a label (name or number)
                for an element. While its value need not be unique, it is
                required to be a single token.</item>
              <item>next, IDREFS, optional<lb/>used to point to the next
                event(s) in a user-defined collection.</item>

              <item>right, data.BARRENDITION, optional<lb/>indicates the
                function of the right barline and is structurally
                important.</item>
              <item>sameas, IDREFS, optional<lb/>points to an element that is
                the same as the current element but is not a literal copy of the
                current element.</item>
              <item>subtype, NMTOKEN, optional<lb/>provide any
                sub-classification for the element, additional to that given by
                its type attribute.</item>
              <item>synch, IDREFS, optional<lb/>points to elements that are
                synchronous with the current element.</item>
              <item>taktplace, data.STAFFLOC, optional<lb/>If takt barlines are
                to be used, then the taktplace attribute may be used to denote
                the staff location of the shortened barline. The location may
                include staff lines, spaces, and the spaces directly above and
                below the staff. The value ranges between 0 (just below the
                staff) to 2 * number of staff lines (directly above the staff).
                For example, on a 5-line staff the lines would be numbered
                1,3,5,7, and 9 while the spaces would be numbered 0,2,4,6,8,10.
                For example, a value of '9' puts the barline through the top
                line of a 5-line staff.</item>
              <item>targettype, NMTOKEN, optional<lb/>in contrast with the role
                attribute, allows the target resource to be characterized, using
                any convenient classification scheme or typology.</item>
              <item>title, TEXT, optional<lb/>
              </item>
              <item>tstamp.ges, data.INTEGERNONNEGATIVE, optional<lb/>used to
                record the onset time in pulses per quarter note (ppq, MusicXML
                divisions, or MIDI clicks) since the start of the file.</item>
              <item>tstamp.real, data.ISOTIME, optional<lb/>holds the onset time
                as a real-time offset, i.e., HH:MM:SS.ss, since the beginning of
                the file.</item>
              <item>type, NMTOKEN, optional<lb/>characterizes the element in
                some sense, using any convenient classification scheme or
                typology.</item>
              <item>when, IDREF, optional<lb/>indicates the point of occurrence
                along a timeline. Its value must be the ID of a
                &lt;when&gt; element.</item>
              <item>width, data.NUMBER, optional<lb/>For rendering purposes,
                some music data systems rely on measure width data. The width
                attribute allows for the capture of this data in MEI for output
                back to these systems.</item>
              <item>xlink:actuate, TOKEN, optional<lb/>defines whether a link
                occurs automatically or must be requested by the user. It is
                used in conjunction with the show attribute to determine link
                behavior.</item>
              <item>xlink:href, data.URI, optional<lb/>allows the use of an
                previously-undeclared URI to identify an external electronic
                object.</item>
              <item>xlink:role, ANYURI, optional<lb/>indicates a property of the
                entire link. The value of the role attribute must be a URI
                reference as defined in [IETF RFC 2396], except that if the URI
                scheme used is allowed to have absolute and relative forms, the
                URI portion must be absolute. The URI reference identifies some
                resource that describes the intended property. When no value is
                supplied, no particular role value is to be inferred.</item>
              <item>xlink:show, TOKEN, optional<lb/>defines whether a remote
                resource that is the target of a link appears at the point of
                the link, replaces the existing link, or appears in a new
                window.</item>

            <p>An alternative visual rendition of the score from a particular

              to indicate voice leading. Next attributes on event elements
              should be used for this purpose. Part elements are useful for
              encoding individual parts when there is no score, such as early
              music part books, when the music has non-aligning barlines, when
              different layout, such as page turns, are needed for the score and
              parts, or for accommodating software that requires part-by-part
              encoding. When assembly of the parts into a score is desired and
              there are non-aligning barlines, barlines which indicate points of
              alignment across all the parts may be marked as 'controlling',
              while non-aligning ones may be marked as 'non-controlling'.</p>

            <head>Description:</head>
            <p>Historically, a phrase mark indicated a "unified melodic idea",
              while the term "slur" was used for two-note legato patterns.
              (Read, p. 265). Nowadays, however, "phrase" and "slur" are often
              used interchangably (Read, p. 265-266), since the visual rendition
              of the two concepts is the same. MEI provides two distinct
              elements so that those users wishing to maintain a distinction for
              historical reasons may do so. If the user does not want to
              maintain the distinction, then the more generic
              &lt;slur&gt; element should be employed. The starting
              point of the phrase may be indicated by either a tstamp,
              tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute, while the ending
              point may be recorded by either a dur, dur.ges or endid attribute.
              It is a semantic error not to specify one starting and one ending
              type of attribute. Either place, bulge, or bezier attributes may
              be used to record the curvature of the phrase.</p>

                e.g., in 4/4 time '4,4,4,4' indicates each quarter note worth of
                shorter notes would be beamed together. Parentheses can be used
                to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example,
                '(4.,4.,4.)' in 9/8 meter indicates one outer beam per measure
                with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration,
                while a measure of 16th notes in 4/4 with beam.group equal to
                '(4,4),(4,4)' will result in a primary beam covering all the
                notes and secondary beams each group of 4 notes. This beaming
                "directive" can be overridden by using &lt;beam&gt;
                elements. If neither &lt;beam&gt; elements or the
                beam.group attribute is used, then no beaming is rendered.

          <div type="desc">
            <head>Description:</head>
            <p>Historically, the term "slur" indicated two notes performed
              legato, while the term "phrase" was used for a "unified melodic
              idea". Nowadays, however, "slur" often has the same meaning as
              "phrase" (See Read, p. 265-266), since the visual rendition of the
              two concepts is the same. MEI provides two distinct elements so
              that those users wishing to maintain a distinction for historical
              reasons may do so. If the user does not want to maintain the
              distinction, then the more generic &lt;slur&gt; element
              should be employed. The starting point of the slur may be
              indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid
              attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a dur,
              dur.ges or endid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify
              one starting and one ending type of attribute. Either place,
              bulge, or bezier attributes may be used to record the curvature of
              the slur. The slur and tie elements may be used instead of the
              slur.* and tie.* attributes provided on chord and note elements
              when 1) they are required by software, or 2) multiple, alternative
              slurs are needed.</p>

                the endpoints of the curve. The bulge attribute must contain one

                differ, it may be necessary to add a dur.vis attribute. Please
                note that the dur attribute is not a true duration, but rather a
                time stamp for the end point of the slur. Durations of longer
                than one measure may give the number of measures followed by the
                timestamp, e.g. "1m+3". Values within the current measure may be
                expressed as "0m+3" or as simply "3".</item>

              <item>beam.group, TEXT, optional<lb/>provides an example of how
                beaming (including secondary beams) is to be performed. It can
                be used to set a default beaming pattern to be used when no
                beaming is indicated at the event level. beam.group must contain
                a comma-separated list of time values that add up to a measure,
                e.g., in 4/4 time '4,4,4,4' indicates each quarter note worth of
                shorter notes would be beamed together. Parentheses can be used
                to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example,
                '(4.,4.,4.)' in 9/8 meter indicates one outer beam per measure
                with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration,
                while a measure of 16th notes in 4/4 with beam.group equal to
                '(4,4),(4,4)' will result in a primary beam covering all the
                notes and secondary beams each group of 4 notes. This beaming
                "directive" can be overridden by using &lt;beam&gt;
                elements. If neither &lt;beam&gt; elements or the
                beam.group attribute is used, then no beaming is rendered.
                Beaming can be 'turned off' by setting beam.group to an empty
                string.</item>
              <item>beam.rend, TOKEN, optional<lb/>encodes whether a beam is

                attribute values in a staff without having to individually
                change each event's grace attribute value. Each "graced" element
                may still require a value in its grace.time attribute.</item>
              <item>grid.show, data.BOOLEAN, optional<lb/>determines whether to
                display guitar chord grids.</item>
              <item>harm.dist, data.NUMBER, optional<lb/>records the default
                distance from the staff of harmonic indications, such as guitar
                chord grids or functional labels.</item>
              <item>id, ID, optional<lb/>regularizes the naming of an element
                and thus facilitates building links between it and other
                resources. Each id attribute within a document must have a
                unique value.</item>
              <item>instr, IDREFS, optional<lb/>provides a way of pointing to a
                MIDI instrument definition. It must contain the ID of an
                &lt;instrdef&gt; element elsewhere in the
                document.</item>
              <item>key.accid, data.ACCIDENTAL.IMPLICIT, optional<lb/>contains
                an accidental for the tonic key, if one is required, e.g., if
                key.pname equals 'c' and key.accid equals 's', then a tonic of
                C# is indicated.</item>
              <item>key.mode, data.MODE, optional<lb/>indicates major or minor
                tonality.</item>
              <item>key.pname, data.PITCHNAME, optional<lb/>holds the pitch name

                key is in the circle of fifths.</item>
              <item>key.sig.mixed, NMTOKEN, optional<lb/>Mixed key signatures,
                e.g. those consisting of a mixture of flats and sharps (Read, p.
                143, ex. 9-39), and key signatures with unorthodox placement of
                the accidentals (Read, p. 141) must be indicated by setting the
                key.sig attribute to 'mixed' and providing explicit keysig info
                in the key.sig.mixed attribute or in the &lt;keysig&gt;
                element. It is intended that key.sig.mixed contain a series of
                tokens with each token containing pitch name, accidental, and
                octave, such as 'As4 Cs5 Ef5' that indicate what key accidentals
                should be rendered and where they should be placed.</item>

              <item>lines.color, NMTOKENS, optional<lb/>encodes the colors of
                the staff lines. The value is structured; that is, it should
                have the same number of space-separated RGB values as the number
                of lines indicated by the lines attribute. A line can be made
                invisible by assigning it the same RGB value as the background,
                usually white.</item>
              <item>lines.visible, data.BOOLEAN, optional<lb/>records whether

              <item>octave.default, data.OCTAVE, optional<lb/>functions
                similarly to dur.default. If the oct attribute isn't given on

                &lt;scoredef&gt; elements) between this staff and the
                preceding one in the same system. This value is meaningless for
                the first staff in a system since the spacing.system attribute
                indicates the spacing between systems.</item>
              <item>tab.strings, TOKEN, optional<lb/>provides a written pitch

              notes. See Read, p. 187-215. The tuplet element may also used for
              bowed tremolo (Read, p. 394) and double, triple, or flutter
              tonguing (Read, p. 348-349); that is, for repetition of the same
